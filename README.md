# postalk

- Title:
    Postalk. A Social networking platform based on posting in which we can share our thought.

- Description:
    It's vary similar with Twitter and Instagram. Postalk is a platform to show one's opinion or thought. We can follow anyone whose contents we want to see. We can hit the like button on which we like.

- Did you choose to use an ORM or raw SQL? Why?:
    I chose the raw SQL first, but changed to ORM. While using ORM, I learned more and understood better, which I wanted to do.

- What future improvements are in store, if any?:
    I wanna make the data visualization when I understand it better. Also, I can add indexing to the database to make the speed higher in the future.
