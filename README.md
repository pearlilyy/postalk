# Postalk
- *What is Postalk?:* A Social networking platform based on posting where we can share our thought. It's very similar to Twitter and Instagram. We can follow anyone whose content we want to subscribe to. We can hit like buttons or make some comments.

- Did you choose to use an *ORM* or *raw SQL*? Why?: I chose the raw SQL first but changed to ORM. While using ORM, I understood it better.

- What future improvements are in store, if any?: I would like to make a data visualization. Also, I can add indexing to the database for better speed.

- *API Reference Table* of endpoint paths, methods, and parameters
